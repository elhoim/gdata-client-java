This directory contains static reference implementations of the Security 
Assertion Markup Language (SAML)-based Single Sign-On Service for Google Hosted
Services. There is an interactive web application reference implementation that 
leads the user through each step of the SAML-based SSO service, from both 
Google's end and the partner's end. This directory captures a snapshot of that 
web application in the form of static HTML files, with Javascript functions to 
simulate each step of the workflow. 

Specifically, this directory contains:

1. saml_sso_workflow.pdf - PDF file containing a detailed diagram of the workflow
2. saml_demo_labeled.html - static demo HTML page (with steps labeled corresponding to the diagram in the PDF)
3. saml_demo.html - static demo HTML page (simulates the web app but with no additional labeling of steps)
