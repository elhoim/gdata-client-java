    SAML-based Single Sign-On for Google Hosted Services - Demo Tool
  </span>
  <p>This static demo of the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)-based 
     Single Sign-On Service for Google Hosted Services is labeled step-by-step 
     to illustrate each step of the SAML workflow between Google and the 
     Partner. You may also refer to the documented workflow. 
  <h1>Pre-Transaction Details</h1>
  <p>This window contains information about actions that occur before the 
     SAML-based SSO authentication process begins. The application assumes 
     a user with the user account <b>demouser@psosamldemo.net</b> is trying 
     to log into a Google-hosted version of the Gmail application.</p>
  <p>These details are established between Google, the Service Provider, and
     the partner company, the Identity Provider, when Single Sign-On service
     is enabled for the partner's Hosted Services account.

  <p>The SAML authentication process begins when a user, who has not already been authenticated, tries to reach the URL for a hosted Google service. In this application, a user is trying to reach the URL <b>http://mail.google.com/a/psosamldemo.net</b>.</p>
