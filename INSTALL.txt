PACKAGE CONTENTS:
-----------------
Google Data APIs ("GData" for short) Java client provides source code and 
libraries for interacting with GData-enabled services.  This package includes
  1. GData Java client source under "gdata/java/src".
  2. GData Java client libraries under "gdata/java/lib".
  3. Ant build configuration to compile the source code.
  4. GData API documentation under "gdata/doc".
  5. Javadoc for client source under "gdata/java/doc".
  6. GData-enabled service specific samples under "gdata/java/sample".

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------
GData Java Client depends on following external libraries on top of standard 
Java installation.
1. mail.jar in Sun's JavaMail API (version 1.4 or greater).
   Sun's JavaMail package available for download from 
   "http://java.sun.com/products/javamail/".
2. activation.jar in Sun's JavaBeansActivationFramewrok.
   This is required only if using JDK version 1.5 or less.
   Sun's JavaBeansActivationFramework is available for download from 
   "http://java.sun.com/products/javabeans/jaf/downloads/index.html".
3. servlet.jar in Sun's Servlet API (version 2.3 or greater).
   This is required only if executing code samples in 'sample.authsub' or
   'sample.gbase.recipe' packages.  Sun's Servlet API package can be
   downloaded from "http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/download.html".

INSTALLATION:
-------------
Update ant build configuration to point to right path for dependency jars.
1. Unpack gdata.java.zip package to local folder.
2. Edit the following lines in "gdata/java/build.properties" to point to 
   correct path for dependency jar files
    activation.jar=<path to activation.jar file>
    mail.jar=<path to mail.jar file>
    servlet.jar=<path to servlet.jar file>
    
EXECUTING SAMPLES:
------------------
GData-enabled service specific samples can be executed through ant build targets.
1. Edit "gdata/java/build.properties" file to specify input data
   for samples. This step is required only for samples that use user data
   from build.properties file.
2. To run a specific sample execute the ant run target corresponding to the sample.
   For example to execute calendar sample, run command "ant sample.calendar.run"
   from folder "gdata/java".
