----------------
February 06, 2007
o  Added "return-empty" query parameter to the Spreadsheet Cells feed.
   When present, empty cells are included in query results.
o  Spreadsheets data API: Modified the Spreadsheet Cells feed to allow
   Update (ie. HTTP PUT) on all cells, even empty ones, to change their
   contents.  The use of INSERT on cells is deprecated.  DELETE is
   synonymous with updating the gs:cell@inputValue to the empty string.
o  Fixed the issue of Calendar API sending never-ending series
   of sharding redirects.
o  Modified default configuration of the METHOD_OVERRIDE_PROPERTY
   system property to false.  The Update and Delete methods now use
   HTTP PUT and DELETE, respectively.  To continue with old behavior:
   Using Java command line argument:
      -Dcom.google.gdata.UseMethodOverride=true
   In client code:
      System.setProperty(HttpGDataRequest.METHOD_OVERRIDE_PROPERTY, "true");
